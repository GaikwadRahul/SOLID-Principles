The function animal_sound does not conform to the open-closed principle because it cannot be closed against new kinds

If we add a new animal, Snake, We have to modify the animal_sound function.
You see, for every new animal, a new logic is added to the animal_sound function.

"""
Animal now has a virtual method make_sound. We have each animal extend the Animal class and implement the virtual make_sound method.
Every animal adds its own implementation on how it makes a sound in the make_sound. 
The animal_sound iterates through the array of animal and just calls its make_sound method.
Now, if we add a new animal, animal_sound doesnâ€™t need to change. 
All we need to do is add the new animal to the animal array.
